### Overview

The approach to solve is as below:

1. Treat the problem as black box as much as possible to the program.
2. Guide the program based on "entropy", how far the current state is from ideal state ("solution")
3. Use of random steps, iterations and corrections to improvise or arrive at the solution

### Design
